#We implement a possible bot for an advertiser in a repeated GSP auction
#The bot of an advertiser is a program that, given the history of what occurred in previous auctions, suggest a bid for the next auction.
#Specifically, a bot takes in input
#- the name of the advertiser (it allows to use the same bot for multiple advertisers)
#- the value of the advertiser (it is necessary for evaluating the utility of the advertiser)
#- the clickthrough rates of the slots
#- the history
#We assume the history is represented as an array that contains an entry for each time step,
#i.e. history[i] contains the information about the i-th auction.
#In particular, for each time step we have that 
#- history[i]["adv_bids"] returns the advertisers' bids as a dictionary in which the keys are advertisers' names and values are their bids
#- history[i]["adv_slots"] returns the assignment as a dictionary in which the keys are advertisers' names and values are their assigned slots
#- history[i]["adv_pays"] returns the payments as a dictionary in which the keys are advertisers' names and values are their assigned prices

#The bot that we implement here is a symple best_response bot:
#it completely disregards the history except the last step,
#and suggest the bid that will maximize the advertiser utility
#given that the other advertisers do not change their bids.
